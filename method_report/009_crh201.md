# ExpansionRx \- Model Summary

# Description of the Model

Algorithm: ChemProp version 2  
Parameters: Bounded-MSE loss across the raw data file

# Additional Steps

Ensemble of pre-training performed including ChemMeleon/AZ publically available weights/pre-training to in-house data & Foundational modelling  
Foundational modelling performed via a transformer-like approach (de novo generation of 10M molecules).

Step 1: REINVENT pre-trained via RL to 25 epochs on ExpRx molecules \+ fully enumerated ExpRx bivalents \[cut and enumerated via all possible payloads and linkers\]) 

Step 2: ChemProp foundation modelling via a CheMeleon-like approach to predict the Mordred fingerprints of generated molecules 

Step 3: Pre-trained model used as starting weights across Task Affinity Groupings (TAG) tasks, with initially frozen MPPN for predefined optimised epochs 

Step 4: MPNN unfrozen and training continues  
De-noising performed on the training set as in: https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/661cd020418a5379b0df1fda with prior models  
Reconciled public data into HLM and MLM CLint endpoints  
Mordred/Jazzy/ECFP features selected on a Task Affinity Group (TAG) basis  
Per-endpoint optimisation & multi-task optimisation performed (most optimal on the test set selected)

# Observed Performance During Training

Performance between test / training is consistent. High variance for bivalent molecules.
