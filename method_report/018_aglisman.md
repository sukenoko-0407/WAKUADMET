### Additional Training Steps

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| HPO | Ray Tune ASHA ~2,000 trials | ✅ Used |
| Joint Sampling | Unified two-stage sampling via `JointSampler` | ✅ Used |
| FFN Variants | MLP, MoE, Branched architectures explored | ✅ Evaluated |
| Supplementary Data | KERMT, PharmaBench integration | 🔮 Future |

**Joint Sampling** combines:

- **Task Oversampling (Stage 1):** α-weighted inverse-power sampling for sparse endpoints
- **Curriculum Learning (Stage 2):** Quality-aware within-task sampling (warmup → expand → robust → polish)
  - *Note:* Curriculum learning was extensively evaluated but **abandoned** after ablation studies showed consistent performance degradation. See [Curriculum Learning Study](#curriculum-learning-study-negative-result) section below.

### Training Performance

- **Convergence:** 60–120 epochs with early stopping on validation MAE
- **Best validation MAE:** 0.4–0.6 (macro-averaged across endpoints)
- **R² range:** 0.40–0.85 (LogD best, Caco-2 and MGMB worst)

| FFN Layers | 1–4 |
| FFN Hidden Dim | 200–1200 |
| Dropout | 0.0–0.2 |
| Aggregation | Normalized sum |

### FFN Architectures Explored

Three FFN types were evaluated during HPO:

| Type | Description | Performance |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **MLP** | Standard multi-layer perceptron | Best overall; used in final ensemble |
| **MoE** | Mixture of Experts with gating network | Competitive (rank 3, 7 in top-10) |
| **Branched** | Shared trunk + task-specific branches | Competitive (rank 5, 6, 10 in top-10) |

The MoE and Branched architectures are implemented in [`src/admet/model/chemprop/ffn.py`](src/admet/model/chemprop/ffn.py).

### CheMeleon Model

CheMeleon uses a pre-trained message passing encoder with a trainable FFN head:

- **Encoder:** Pre-trained Chemprop message passing network (frozen by default)
- **Checkpoint:** Auto-downloaded from Zenodo
- **FFN Head:** Supports all three architectures (MLP, MoE, Branched)
- **Transfer Learning:** Optionally unfreeze encoder for fine-tuning

CheMeleon and Chemprop share a unified FFN factory ([`src/admet/model/ffn_factory.py`](src/admet/model/ffn_factory.py)) for consistent architecture support.

### Multi-Task Learning

- **Output:** 9 endpoints predicted simultaneously
- **Loss:** Weighted MSE with NaN masking (missing endpoints ignored in gradient)
- **Task Weights:** Configurable per-endpoint weights (default: uniform 1.0)
- **Joint Sampling:** Unified `JointSampler` with two-stage algorithm:
  1. **Stage 1 (Task Selection):** Sample task `t` with probability `p_t ∝ count_t^(-α)` to balance sparse endpoints
  2. **Stage 2 (Within-Task):** Sample molecule from task's valid indices, weighted by curriculum phase

#### Weighted Multi-Task Loss Function

The total loss for a batch is computed as the weighted sum of per-task losses with NaN masking:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} w_t \cdot \mathcal{L}_t$$

where:

- $T = 9$ (number of ADMET endpoints)
- $w_t$ = weight for task $t$ (configurable via `target_weights`)
- $\mathcal{L}_t$ = masked MSE loss for task $t$

**Per-Task Masked MSE Loss:**

$$\mathcal{L}_t = \frac{1}{|M_t|} \sum_{i \in M_t} (y_i^{(t)} - \hat{y}_i^{(t)})^2$$

where:

- $M_t$ = set of samples with valid (non-NaN) labels for task $t$
- $y_i^{(t)}$ = true label for sample $i$, task $t$
- $\hat{y}_i^{(t)}$ = predicted value for sample $i$, task $t$

**NaN Masking:** Samples with missing labels for a given task are excluded from that task's loss computation, allowing the model to learn from partial labels without requiring complete annotations.

#### Task Weight Strategy

| Strategy | Configuration | Use Case |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Uniform** | `target_weights: [1.0, ...]` | Default; equal importance for all endpoints |
| **Inverse Frequency** | $w_t \propto 1/count_t$ | Upweight rare endpoints |
| **Performance-Based** | $w_t \propto 1/MAE_t$ | Focus on underperforming tasks |
| **HPO-Optimized** | Search over weight space | Find optimal balance (future work) |

**Current Production Configuration:**

```yaml
target_weights:
  - 1.0  # LogD
  - 1.0  # Log KSOL
  - 1.0  # Log HLM CLint
  - 1.0  # Log MLM CLint
  - 1.0  # Log Caco-2 Permeability Papp A>B
  - 1.0  # Log Caco-2 Permeability Efflux
  - 1.0  # Log MPPB
  - 1.0  # Log MBPB
  - 1.0  # Log MGMB
```

**Note:** While the loss function supports non-uniform weights, the final production models use uniform weighting. Task-specific loss weighting is complementary to (not a replacement for) task oversampling—the former adjusts gradient magnitudes while the latter controls sampling frequency

## Data Harmonization and Transformations

### Unit Harmonization

All datasets were transformed to common units before merging:

| Endpoint | Final Units | Storage Format |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| LogD | dimensionless | Linear (untransformed) |
| KSOL (Kinetic Solubility) | μM | log₁₀(μM) |
| HLM CLint | mL/min/kg | log₁₀(mL/min/kg) |
| MLM CLint | mL/min/kg | log₁₀(mL/min/kg) |
| Caco-2 Papp A→B | 10⁻⁶ cm/s | log₁₀(10⁻⁶ cm/s) |
| Caco-2 Efflux Ratio | dimensionless | log₁₀(ratio) |
| MPPB (Mouse PPB) | % unbound | log₁₀(% unbound) |
| MBPB (Mouse Brain) | % unbound | log₁₀(% unbound) |
| MGMB (Mouse Gut Microbiome) | % unbound | log₁₀(% unbound) |

### Source-Specific Transformations

#### KERMT Public

| Source Column | Transformation | Target Column |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| `LogD_pH_7.4` | Identity | LogD |
| `kinetic_logSaq` (log M) | 10^(x+6) | KSOL (μM) |
| `CL_microsome_human` (log mL/min/kg) | 10^x × 10⁻³ | HLM CLint |
| `CL_microsome_mouse` (log mL/min/kg) | 10^x × 10⁻³ | MLM CLint |
| `Papp_Caco2` (log 10⁻⁶ cm/s) | 10^x | Caco-2 Papp |
| `Rat_fraction_unbound_plasma` (log %) | 10^x | MPPB |
| `Pgp_human` (log ratio) | 10^x | Caco-2 Efflux* |

*Low confidence mapping: P-gp efflux ≠ Caco-2 efflux ratio

#### KERMT Biogen

| Source Column | Transformation | Target Column |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| `SOLY_6.8` (μg/mL) | (x / MW) × 10³ | KSOL (μM)* |
| `MDR1-MDCK_ER` | Identity | Caco-2 Efflux* |
| `HLM_CLint` (log) | 10^x | HLM CLint |
| `Rat_fraction_unbound_plasma` (log %) | 10^x | MPPB |

*Caveats: Different assay conditions (pH 6.8 vs 7.0-7.4; MDCK vs Caco-2)

#### PharmaBench

| Source Column | Transformation | Target Column |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| `logd_reg` | Identity | LogD |
| `water_sol_reg` (log nM) | 10^x / 1000 | KSOL (μM) |

| `mou_mic_cl_reg` (log mL/min/g) | 10^x | MLM CLint |
| `ppb_reg` (%) | Identity | MPPB |

### Post-Transformation Processing

1. **Log₁₀ Transformation:** All endpoints except LogD are stored as log₁₀ values
2. **Outlier Handling:** For binding/clearance endpoints (MPPB, MBPB, MGMB, HLM CLint, MLM CLint), values below -3.0 (log scale) are set to NaN as likely measurement artifacts
3. **SMILES Canonicalization:** All SMILES canonicalized with RDKit (isomeric=True, canonical=True) using [`src/admet/data/smiles.py`](src/admet/data/smiles.py):
   - **Salt Removal:** RDKit SaltRemover strips counter-ions while preserving the parent molecule
   - **Validation:** Invalid SMILES that fail parsing return None and are excluded
   - **Empty Check:** Molecules with zero atoms after salt removal are excluded
   - **Parallel Processing:** Thread pool (max 32 workers) for batch canonicalization
4. **Duplicate Handling:** Duplicate canonical SMILES within datasets averaged (excluding NaN)

## Quality Categorization

### Quality Tiers

Data quality is assigned per-endpoint based on:

1. **Assay protocol alignment** with challenge data
2. **Measurement conditions** (pH, cell type, species)
3. **Distribution overlap** with ExpansionRx data

| Dataset | LogD | KSOL | HLM CLint | MLM CLint | Caco-2 Papp | Caco-2 Efflux | MPPB | MBPB | MGMB |
|---------|------|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|------|------|------|
| ExpansionRx | High | High | High | High | High | High | High | High | High |
| KERMT Public | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | Low | — | — |
| KERMT Biogen | — | Low | Low | — | — | Medium | Medium | — | — |
| PharmaBench | Medium | Low | Medium | Medium | — | — | Low | — | — |

### Quality Rationale

- **High:** ExpansionRx challenge data with standardized protocols
- **Medium:** Comparable assay conditions, similar value distributions
- **Low:** Different assay conditions, protocol mismatches, or distribution shifts
- **—:** Endpoint not available in dataset

**Key insights:**

- MLP architectures dominate top ranks but MoE/Branched are competitive
- Task sampling α = 0.02–0.2 appears optimal
- Moderate dropout (0.05–0.15) preferred
- Deeper message passing (4–7) with moderate dimensions (700–1100)

### Joint Sampling Strategy

**Purpose:** Unified sampling combining task-aware oversampling with curriculum learning via the `JointSampler` class.

**Two-Stage Algorithm:**

1. **Stage 1 (Task Selection):** Sample task `t` with probability:
   $$p_t \propto count_t^{-\alpha}$$
   where `count_t` = samples with labels for task `t`

2. **Stage 2 (Within-Task):** Sample molecule from task's indices, weighted by curriculum phase proportions

**Task Sampling Alpha (`task_oversampling.alpha`):**

| α Value | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| 0.0 | Uniform task sampling (no rebalancing) |
| 0.02–0.1 | Mild rebalancing (recommended; used in top configs) |
| 0.5–1.0 | Aggressive; may hurt overall MAE |

**Configuration:**

```yaml
joint_sampling:
  enabled: true
  task_oversampling:
    alpha: 0.02  # Mild rebalancing for sparse endpoints
  curriculum:
    enabled: false  # Not used in final production model
```

**Note:** Curriculum learning was extensively evaluated during HPO, but the best-performing models used only task oversampling (α = 0.02).

---

## Ensemble Strategy

### Configuration

- **Splits:** 5 Butina clustering splits
- **Folds:** 5-fold CV per split
- **Total models:** 25
- **Clustering:** Taylor-Butina on molecular fingerprints
- **Training Strategy:** HPO and architecture evaluation used 88% of data (12% temporal holdout); final ensemble trained on full dataset with 5×5 CV

## Curriculum Learning Study (Negative Result)

### Summary

We conducted a comprehensive ablation study to evaluate curriculum learning for leveraging external ADMET datasets of varying quality. **All experiments showed significant performance degradation compared to the base model.**

| Experiment | Test MAE | Test R² | vs Base MAE |
|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Base Model (High-Quality Only)** | **0.307** | **0.582** | — |
| 01 Baseline Curriculum | 0.385 | 0.297 | +25.4% worse |
| 02 Two-Quality Only | 0.355 | 0.407 | +15.7% worse |
| 03 Selective Tasks (Loss Weighting) | 0.378 | 0.334 | +23.2% worse |
| 04 High-Quality Focus | 0.381 | 0.317 | +24.0% worse |
| 05 Finetune Approach | 0.372 | 0.339 | +21.2% worse |

### Key Findings

1. **Catastrophic forgetting** on 3 endpoints (Caco-2 Papp, Caco-2 Efflux, MGMB) — R² dropped from positive to negative
2. **Extreme data sparsity** in external datasets (>90% missing for most endpoints) disrupted multi-task learning
3. **Distribution shift** between high-quality and external data sources compounded the problem
4. **None of the mitigations tested** (excluding low-quality data, loss weighting, HQ monitoring, fine-tuning) recovered base model performance

### Recommendation

**Abandon curriculum learning with current external datasets.** The data quality and coverage issues cause more harm than benefit. Future work should focus on:

- Data-centric improvements (quality filtering, distribution alignment)
- Per-endpoint curriculum enabling only for well-covered endpoints
- Alternative approaches like self-training with pseudo-labels

### Data Harmonization Caveats (Future Work)

> **Note:** Supplementary data integration was evaluated but not used in the final submission.

1. **Assay Condition Mismatches:**
   - KERMT Biogen solubility at pH 6.8 vs challenge pH ~7.0-7.4
   - KERMT Biogen efflux from MDCK cells vs Caco-2 cells
   - P-gp efflux (KERMT Public) ≠ Caco-2 efflux ratio

2. **Species Differences:** MPPB uses rat in some datasets, mouse in others

### Model Limitations

- **Domain:** Trained on drug-like small molecules; may not generalize to natural products, peptides, PROTACs
- **Sparse Endpoints:** MBPB/MGMB rely solely on ExpansionRx data
- **No Calibrated Uncertainty:** Ensemble stderr is spread, not confidence intervals
- **Uniform Task Weights:** Loss function uses equal weighting (1.0) for all endpoints; task sampling alpha compensates but per-endpoint loss weighting could improve performance
